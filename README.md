# Particles wallpaper

This project is very simple implementation of [particles.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js) for [Lively wallpaper](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively)

### How to use

To use Particle wallpaper, you must install [Lively wallpaper](https://rocksdanister.github.io/lively), then in the "[releases](https://github.com/Disk-MTH/Particles-wallpaper/releases)" tab, download the latest version. 
Put the downloaded folder in a place where you will be sure not to touch it again. 
Then in Lively wallpaper, click the "+" to add a new background and browse files to select the zip folder. The wallpaper will be imported, you just have to use it.

### How to edit

The main thing you might want to change is the animation, the color, the number... of particles and for that change the settings in the "[app.js](https://github.com/Disk-MTH/Particles-wallpaper/blob/master/js/app.js)" file. 
You can find the documentation for the library [here](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/blob/master/README.md).
